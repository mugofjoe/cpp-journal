# Context

## Modern C++

- Smart pointers that handle memory management for you

- Managing memory yourself is old-school

- Generics are resolved at runtime. That means every time your application
runs, some number of cycles are going to be spent figuring out what type do I use,
what method do I call, what's going on here.

- Templates in C++ are resolved at compile time. Those cycles are not spent on runtime.
