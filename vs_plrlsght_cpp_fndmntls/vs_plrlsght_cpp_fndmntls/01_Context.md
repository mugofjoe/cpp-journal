# Context

## Modern C++

- Smart pointers that handle memory management for you

- Managing memory yourself is old-school

- Generics are resolved at runtime. That means every time your 
application runs, some number of cycles are going to be spent 
figuring out what type do I use, what method do I call, what's going on here.

- Templates in C++ are resolved at compile time. Those cycles 
are not spent on runtime.

## C++/CLI

- C++/CLI is a variant that makes managed code
- Excellent for wrappers around native libraries so they can be called from
.NET
- Has a few extra pieces of syntax to support CLR concepts
- Learning C++ means you essentially know C++/CLI too
