# Classes and objects

- `class` to define a class
	- Remember: there's a trailing semicolon at the end _`;`_
- inside of a class: private and public sections
	- you don't go line by line (this element is private, this element is public)
	- default is `private`
	- best practice: no public member variables
- declare an instance with same syntax as fundamental types
- access member variables and functions with dot (.)
	- static members and functions with class name and colon-colon (::)

## _`stdafx.h`_ 

This is the standard C++ precompiled header

## Creating a class

We are creating a Person class.
We create a Person.h header file.

- The values for most types in C++ are not defaulted or initialized for you.
	- It's possible for objects to have the defaulted and initialized.
	- It's not possible for integers to be initialized.
