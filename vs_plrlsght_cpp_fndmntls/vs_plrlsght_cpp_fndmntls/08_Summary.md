# Summary: Pointers
- Pointers and references provide another
way to access memory

- const keeps your programs correct
	- functions that take literal values need to be
  aware of const.
	- const-correctness spreads through your code
  - if you take a reference (for speed)
  you should probably take a const reference
	- many operator overloads, constructors and
  other canonical functions take const references.

- The free store (aka the heap) gives objects
a lifetime longer than local scope
